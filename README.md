Wassup Bot
==========
This bot asks you in specific intervals about what you are doing. It helps to keep track of how you are spending your time.

Usage:
node wassup.js \<bot's id\> \<bot's password\>

While running:
- send '/run' or '/start' to start the timer.
- send '/stop' to stop the timer.
- send '/mute <some string>' to save <some string> as the activity and reset the timer.
- send '<any string>' as the current activity without resetting the timer.
